* Katti who?  ðŸš€ 

Katti is in the development phase. We are continuously working on improving Katti and adding new features. Therefore we will release new versions in regular intervals.

The development of Katti started as a pure crawling framework. In the meantime, Katti not only offers the possibility to automatically load websites and store the data, but also provides the tools to analyze the obtained data. The goal is to develop a scalable platform that allows an easy automated analysis of websites and their infrastructure.

* Disclaimer
At the moment we are in the process of releasing Katti v0.2. The proof of concept of the crawling engine can be found [[https://github.com/Flojo-der-erste/katti][here]]. The crawling engine is part of our demo paper for WebConf 2023. The paper can be found [[https://doi.acm.org?doi=3543873.3587351][here]].
Katti v.0.2 will include a number of enhancements, such as a solution to the Docker container startup problem mentioned in the paper.
